                    <p>Many Hands International (MHI) started in 2008 with the concept of a kombit, a Haitian term that describes kind of communal undertaking to accomplish a great task. MHI is being directed by an unpaid staff of six individuals and a Board of four members. These individuals devote their time, energy, and resources to establishing and running this organization. MHI is registered in the state of Florida as a public charity. As such, it has a fully functioning board and a formal mission statement.<br><br>At Many Hands International, we recognize that it takes MANY hands to make an impact in the lives of our students and their families in Haiti. We need your support, your donations, your HANDS.</p>
